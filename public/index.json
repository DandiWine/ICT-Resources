This is similar to how Morse code encodes a message using a series of dots and dashes.\nManchester encoding represents a 0 bit by a high to low voltage transition, and a 1 bit is represented as a low to high voltage transition.\nThis type of encoding is used in 10 Mbps Ethernet. Faster data rates require more complex encoding. Manchester encoding is used in older Ethernet standards such as 10BASE-T. Ethernet 100BASE-TX uses 4B/5B encoding and 1000BASE-T uses 8B/10B encoding.\nSignaling # The physical layer must generate the electrical, optical, or wireless signals that represent the \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; on the media. The way that bits are represented is called the signaling method.\na change in the level of an electrical signal or optical pulse. For example, a long pulse might represent a 1 whereas a short pulse might represent a 0.\nThis is similar to the signaling method used in Morse code, which may use a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks to send text over telephone wires or between ships at sea.\nThe figures display signaling\nBandwidth # Latency\nLatency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another.\nIn an internetwork, or a network with multiple segments, throughput cannot be faster than the slowest link in the path from source to destination. Even if all, or most, of the segments have high bandwidth, it will only take one segment in the path with low throughput to create a bottleneck in the throughput of the entire network.\nThroughput\nThroughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.\nDue to a number of factors, throughput usually does not match the specified bandwidth in physical layer implementations. Throughput is usually lower than the bandwidth. There are many factors that influence throughput:\nThe amount of traffic The type of traffic The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination There are many online speed tests that can reveal the throughput of an internet connection. The figure provides sample results from a speed test.\nGoodput\nThere is a third measurement to assess the transfer of usable data; it is known as goodput. Goodput is the measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time. Goodput is throughput minus traffic overhead for establishing sessions, acknowledgments, encapsulation, and retransmitted bits. Goodput is always lower than throughput, which is generally lower than the bandwidth.\n=====================================================================\nCopper Cabling # A pure digital signal is transmitted. On the medium, there is an interference signal. The digital signal is corrupted by the interference signal. The receiving computer reads a changed signal. Notice that a 0 bit is now interpreted as a 1 bit copper cables are wrapped in metallic shielding and require proper grounding connections.\nTo counter the negative effects of crosstalk, some types of copper cables have opposing circuit wire pairs twisted together, which effectively cancels the crosstalk.\nUTP cabling: # Standards for cables and connectors # UTP cabling conforms to the standards established jointly by the ANSI/TIA\nthe standard most commonly used in LAN cabling environments. Some of the elements defined are as follows:\nCable types Cable lengths Connectors Cable termination Methods of testing cable The electrical characteristics of copper cabling are defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\nCables are placed into categories based on their ability to carry higher bandwidth rates\nCategory 5 cable is used commonly in 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet installations\nCables in higher categories are designed and constructed to support higher data rates.\nCategory 6 is recommended for new buildings.\nThe figure shows three categories of UTP cable:\nCategory 3 was originally used for voice communication over voice lines, but later used for data transmission. Category 5 and 5e are used for data transmission. Category 5 supports 100Mbps and Category 5e supports 1000 Mbps. Category 6 has an added separator between each wire pair to support higher speeds. Category 6 supports up to 10 Gbps. Category 7 also supports 10 Gbps. Category 8 supports 40 Gbps. Pins in UTP cabling # Fiber Optics # types of fiber optics media\nSingle-mode fiber (SMF) Multimode fiber (MMF) Fiber-optic cabling uses: # Fiber-optic cabling is now being used in four types of industry:\nEnterprise Networks - This is used for backbone cabling applications and interconnecting infrastructure devices. Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) - This is used to provide always-on broadband services to homes and small businesses. Long-Haul Networks - This is used by service providers to connect countries and cities. Submarine Cable Networks - This is used to provide reliable high-speed, high-capacity solutions capable of surviving in harsh undersea environments at up to transoceanic distances. Search the internet for “submarine cables telegeography map” to view various maps online. but this module mainly focuses on enterprise networks.\n# Fiber Optics Connectors: # An optical-fiber connector terminates the end of an optical fiber.\nThere are now main four standards.\nST connectors were one of the first connector types used. The connector locks securely with a \u0026rsquo;twist-on/twist-off\u0026rsquo; bayonet-style mechanism.\nSC connectors are sometimes referred to as \u0026lsquo;square connectors\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;standard connectors\u0026rsquo;. They are a widely-adopted LAN and WAN connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to ensure positive insertion. This connector type is used with multimode and single-mode fiber.\nA duplex multimode LC connector is similar to an LC simplex connector, but uses a duplex connector.\nLC simplex connectors are a smaller version of the SC connector. These are sometimes called little or local connectors and are quickly growing in popularity due to their smaller size.\nFiber Vs Copper # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/networking/purpose-of-the-physical-layer/","section":"Networking","summary":"","title":"Purpose of the physical layer","type":"networking"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"A test for the _index.md for the networking catagory.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/networking/test/","section":"Networking","summary":"","title":"test","type":"networking"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/troubleshooting/","section":"Troubleshootig","summary":"my notes from documenting troubleshooting processes","title":"Troubleshootig","type":"troubleshooting"},{"content":" Why i made this website? # Core Reasons # I am an ICT Student, and the more i learn the more i really think i should document a lot.
