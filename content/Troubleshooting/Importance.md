### Why Document?

Ever had your PS4 give up? Your phone? And you had to look up on Google/Youtube to be able to fix it?
That is why documentation is so important. Writing down potentional fixes for common problems to even complex ones.
Writing down what worked in the past to try that again, and if that did not do anything sill write everything down and so on.

It could prevent potentional headaches and lead to a more efficiant workflow. (plus all the E-waste you are preventing with making it public)
