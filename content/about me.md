# Why i made this website?

## Core Reasons

I am an ICT Student, and the more i learn the more i really think i should document a lot.
I got tired of constantly snooping in my Google drive and making all these documents.
The more you learn the more important it is to make notes.
And the more important to document, so you can work faster in the future or look back that you are smarter than befoore:p

So my initial thought became to build my own site with hugo and hosting on GitHub.
It has been hectic and a bit technical, but with time and efforot i eventually got it online.


**More to come in the future**
