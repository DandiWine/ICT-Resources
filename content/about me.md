# Why i made this website?

## Core Reasons

I am an ICT Student, and the more i learn the more i really think i should document a lot.
I got tired of constantly snooping in my Google drive and making all these documents.
The more you learn the more important it is to take notes.
the more you document, the faster you can work in case you forget and coffee isn't enough.

So my initial thought became to build my own site with hugo and hosting it on GitHub.
It has been hectic and a bit technical, but with time and efforot i eventually got it online.

My goal with this mainly is to pressrve my lessons for the public and for my collegues in my classroom.
To spread around infromation for the nerdy that don't know where to start.


**More to come in the future**
